After clearing customs, it was already 11:10. Follow the Bus signs out of the airport, cross the road and turn right; where there are many people is the S1 bus stop. Take the Citybus Airport Express S1 and get off at Tung Chung Station Bus Terminus. Then transfer to the MTR Tung Chung Line to Olympic Station, go to 7-ELEVEn (Olympian City) to buy a Club Sim card. By then, it was already 12:31. Exit C of the metro leads directly to HSBC Centre.

Walk to Yesinn @ YMT (Yau Ma Tei Yesinn Youth Hostel) to check in; by then, it was 15:51. City Walk 1 16 July Yau Ma Tei → Tsim Sha Tsui By evening, I finally packed away all my paperwork and walked from the hostel to the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui. The sea breeze carried a moist, salty scent, and the lights on both sides of Victoria Harbour shimmered on the water. In that moment, the fatigue of the day was washed away by the night view. City Walk 2 17 July Tsim Sha Tsui → Central → Causeway Bay → Tsim Sha Tsui The next day, I decided to slow down a bit. In the morning, I walked to Star Ferry Terminal, Tsim Sha Tsui, bought a ticket, queued up, and boarded the Star Ferry—an ordinary-looking boat that carries countless memories. As the ferry left the pier, a cool breeze hit my face, and the Hong Kong Island skyline slowly approached. After arriving at Central Ferry Pier, I took a bus and then walked to Causeway Bay, enjoying the city scenery along the way. The minimalism of MUJI, the familiarity of IKEA, and the lively atmosphere of Donki each offered a different shopping experience. In the evening, I walked along the street to Wan Chai Pier and took the Star Ferry again, watching the water turn orange-red in the sunset. Returning to Tsim Sha Tsui, I took a bus back to Yesinn @ YMT, ending two packed but fulfilling days.

During this process, many memories suddenly resurfaced, as if I was once again on that familiar and long road. A year has passed, many things have changed, but the feelings and thoughts from that journey remain vivid. So, I decided to write them down—for my present self, and for someday in the future when I look back.\nMain Text # Looking back on this experience, it can be as long or as short as you want.\nIf I write too much, I worry my future self will be too lazy to read; if I write too little, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it will be lost in the river of time.\nSo I’ll just leave this part, which touched me the most and is most worth recording.\nThe biggest feeling from cycling 318 is: Once you choose a road, walk it firmly.\nWhy do I say this? Because this 2,160 km Sichuan-Tibet Route 318, starting from Chengdu, made me truly experience that the “road” is never fixed—it’s neither perfect nor simple.\nI rode through country lanes and got lost at highway entrances;\nExperienced days stranded by flat tires and delays, and moments of endless climbing that left me breathless;\nWalked misty mountain roads in the rain and fog, greeted monkeys along the way;\nClimbed wild hills at midnight for hot springs, and after fixing a tire, got caught in hail and rain so heavy I couldn’t see the road;\nThere were plateaus, muddy construction, roaring trucks in long tunnels, landslides\u0026hellip;\nOf course, there were also roads with breathtaking scenery that made me stop in awe.\nThe diversity and challenge of just the “road” alone is so rich, yet it’s only part of the journey.\nThe people along the way, the stories I encountered, the loneliness and excitement, the surging emotions inside\u0026hellip;\nThere’s so much more, far beyond what a few words can express.\nThis is one road, but it let me experience countless possibilities of what a “road” can be.\nBut none of that matters anymore. What matters is: I didn’t get lost. I knew I was riding toward Tibet, toward Lhasa.\nIsn’t life the same?\nSometimes we care too much about which road “looks better” right now—smoother, more profitable—and forget the most crucial thing: Are you moving toward your goal?\nWhat 318 taught me is that once you’ve chosen your goal, even if the road you’re on isn’t perfect, isn’t comfortable, or doesn’t seem “worth it,” as long as it leads toward the destination, it’s worth sticking to.\nGo a segment, then another, and piece together those fragments into the complete path to your dream.\nOn the other hand, those “good-looking” roads—if they only take you further off course—are the real detour.\nSo, after finishing 318, I have more courage to face life’s choices.\nI no longer blindly pursue the “best road,” but have learned to ask myself: Is this the road that brings me closer to my destination?\nAs long as the answer is yes, then just like cycling 318, even if it’s wind and rain all the way, it’s worth it.\nPhoto Gallery (251 photos) # Closing Remark / Motto # Not every step is perfect, but every step brings you closer to the distance.\n","date":"25 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/life-1-road-318/","section":"Blog","summary":"Looking back on a year of cycling along National Highway 318, reflecting on those imperfect but goal-oriented roads.","title":"Reflections on the First Anniversary of Cycling China's 318","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/how-to-master-japanese/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"How to Master Japanese","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"1 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/japanese/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Japanese","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/resources/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Resources","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"Back to the series index\n★Learning Resources # The Resources ★📖 Dictionaries # Jisho.org: Japanese Dictionary Takoboto | Japanese dictionary and Nihongo learning tool How to Pronounce Japanese Like a Native | Youglish ★📖 Reading Resources # Aozora Bunko Aozora Bunko Assistant National Diet Library Search (NDL Search) Z-library Project - eBook Library Z.

The textbook not only focuses on language knowledge but also emphasizes practical application in real-life scenarios. Its learning objectives are based on the JF Standard for Japanese-Language Education (Can-do), enabling learners to handle various everyday situations in Japan, such as shopping, work, and social interactions.\nKey features of Irodori:\nExpands what learners \u0026ldquo;can do\u0026rdquo; in Japanese living scenarios Covers Japanese proficiency at AI–A2 levels Aligns with the \u0026ldquo;JF Can-do for Life in Japan\u0026rdquo; framework Promotes mutual understanding through communication and cultural exchange Includes diverse topics closely related to daily life Utilizes rich audio and authentic materials for practical Japanese learning Solidifies grammar and kanji knowledge Freely downloadable from the official website Loosely connected to the Marugoto series ★Textbook Structure # The IRODORI series consists of three volumes: Starter (A1), Elementary 1 (A2), and Elementary 2 (A2). Each volume is organized as follows:\nTextbook (PDF) Audio Files (MP3) Supplementary Materials ※ 【Cover】 【Lessons 1–18】 【Answer Key】 【Preface】【How to Use This Textbook】 【Vocabulary List】 【Table of Contents】 【Teaching Guide】 【Lessons 1–18】\nExercises, Listening Scripts, Kanji Vocabulary, Grammar Notes, Japanese Life \u0026amp; Culture 【Can-do Self-Assessment Sheet】 【Copyright Page】 ★How to Use the Textbook # ◇Lesson Structure # Each volume (Starter, Elementary 1, Elementary 2) comprises 9 themes and 18 lessons. Each lesson is designed for 150–180 minutes of instruction, though timing may vary based on exercise volume.\n【Theme \u0026amp; Lesson Title】 【Warm-up Questions】 Helps learners contextualize the lesson’s topic through personal reflection or group discussion. 【Exercises】 Core component for achieving Can-do goals. Each lesson includes 3–6 exercises to master practical Japanese. 【Listening Scripts】 【Kanji Vocabulary】 Introduces kanji encountered in exercises. 【Grammar Notes】 Explains sentence patterns and expressions from the lesson. 【Japanese Life \u0026amp; Culture】 Provides insights into cultural or situational contexts from the exercises. ◇Exercise Types and Goals # Each lesson includes Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing exercises. While each exercise is standalone, they are thematically linked within a lesson. Speaking exercises are emphasized across the series.\nSpeaking Ask/answer questions about familiar topics; give simple descriptions about oneself or surroundings. Listening Grasp key points in daily conversations; extract essential information from announcements or simple news. Reading Understand notices, signs, menus, or pamphlets written in plain Japanese. Writing Fill out forms, send messages, or post simple updates on social media. ◇Universal Learning Flow # All exercises follow this sequence: ➊ Confirm Can-do Review the exercise’s goal. ➋ Exercise Practice listening/speaking/reading/writing. ➌ Self-Assessment Use the Can-do sheet to evaluate progress and jot down reflections. 🟢 Step-by-Step Guide: 1. Review Can-do Goal 2. Preview Vocabulary 3. Listen/Read (Model Dialogue) 4. Focus on Form ↓ Fill in blanks to observe patterns. ↓ Analyze usage via Grammar Notes. ↓ Reinforce with the Grammar Workbook (optional). 5. Speaking Practice Shadowing or role-play after mastering forms. 6. Can-do Check Reflect and plan next steps. IRODORI prioritizes input-first learning: noticing forms, deducing rules, then applying them. Avoid starting with grammar drills—contextual practice is key.\n❌ Ineffective Approach:\nTeach grammar → Explain via Grammar Notes → Drill with Workbook → Begin exercises. The Grammar Workbook supplements IRODORI but is meaningless without the main textbook’s communicative practice.\n◇Speaking Exercises # Speaking ➊ Confirm Can-do ➋ Vocabulary Prep Learn terms via: 1. Match audio to illustrations 2. Imitate pronunciation 3. Select correct image after listening (linking meaning to form). ➌ Listen to Model Dialogue Focus on gist, not details. Two types: - Short dialogues (no script): Later found in Listening Scripts. - Long dialogues (with script): Read after initial listening. ➍ Focus on Form 1. Notice underlined patterns in dialogues. 2. Answer ❕ questions to deduce rules before checking Grammar Notes. 3. Re-listen to observe usage. ➎ Speaking Practice 1. Listen to model dialogue 2. Shadowing: Repeat with/without scripts. 3. Guided drills (e.g., word substitution) 4. Free conversation: Role-play or personalize. ➏ Self-Assessment ℹ️ Shadowing: Instant repetition of heard phrases, like an echo, to improve fluency.\n◇Listening Exercises # Listening ➊ Confirm Can-do ➋ Vocabulary Prep Same as Speaking. ➌ Listening Task 1. Preview context (setting/purpose). 2. Answer questions while listening (e.g., match images, note keywords). 3. Re-listen after checking new terms (optional). ➍ Focus on Form Analyze new patterns if present. ➎ Self-Assessment ◇Reading Exercises # Reading ➊ Confirm Can-do ➋ Reading Task 1. Preview context. 2. Skim for gist → Scan for details. - Real-life texts lack furigana; guess meanings from context. - Check 🔖 Key Words afterward. ➌ Reflect Compare with personal experiences (optional discussion). ➍ Focus on Form Study patterns via fill-in-blanks (if applicable). ➎ Self-Assessment ◇Writing Exercises # Writing ➊ Confirm Can-do ➋ Writing Task 1. Review context. 2. Read examples (may reuse Reading texts). 3. Write (handwrite or type, as situation demands). 4. Share feedback (peer review for real-world relevance). ➌ Self-Assessment ◇Kanji Vocabulary # Learners practice 429 kanji (across all levels) in context. Goals: recognize meanings in daily life and input via devices (no handwriting required). Steps:\n➊ Check readings/meanings (multiple fonts shown).\n➋ Read in sentences.\n➌ Type on devices (handwriting optional for enthusiasts).\n◇Grammar Notes # Explains patterns from \u0026ldquo;Focus on Form\u0026rdquo; sections. Includes:\nForm/meaning/usage per lesson. Additional examples or comparisons. Part-of-speech labels:\nN = Noun | ナA = ナ-adjective | イA = イ-adjective | V = Verb | S = Sentence. Teachers may use this for explanations or assign as homework. For deeper grammar study, use MARUGOTO’s \u0026ldquo;Rikai\u0026rdquo; series, but stay aligned with Can-do goals.\n◇Japanese Life \u0026amp; Culture # A photo-rich column offering practical tips about Japan. Topics align with lesson themes and cater to learners unfamiliar with Japan. Can be explored independently or in class.\nReference Links:\nIrodori Official Site JF Can-do for Life in Japan Back to the series index\n","date":"28 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/japanese-5-textbook-irodori/","section":"Blog","summary":"Introduces the content features and study recommendations of the Japanese textbook ‘いろどり’.","title":"The Japanese textbook Irodori","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"27 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/methods/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Methods","type":"tags"},{"content":"Back to the series index\nIntroduction to Learning Japanese: Efficient Methods # 1. Find a Textbook (Recommended: \u0026ldquo;Minna no Nihongo\u0026rdquo; (みんなの日本語)) # Reasons for Recommendation: Textbooks written by Japanese authors contain errors commonly made by Japanese people, which won\u0026rsquo;t affect your Japanese proficiency in the eyes of native speakers. The key is to choose a textbook that suits you and that you can learn from, rather than one with perfect content. Textbook Structure: Main Book (entirely in Japanese) Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Guide (includes vocabulary lists, Chinese explanations, etc.) 2. Prepare a Repeater or Repeater Software # Functional Requirements: Able to set repeat positions. Preferably has a function for decomposing and memorizing recordings. 3. Pre-class Preparation # 1. Do Not Read the Text First; Start with the Vocabulary and Grammar Explanations # If using \u0026ldquo;Minna no Nihongo,\u0026rdquo; only refer to the Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Guide and avoid the main book content. Also, skip the text translation parts in the Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Guide initially. 2. Memorize Vocabulary and Grammar First # Memorize Vocabulary by Listening to Recordings # Initial Memorization\nListen to the recordings while looking at the vocabulary and explanations, trying to remember a few words. Do not stress; gradually familiarize yourself with the pronunciation, form, conjugations (for verbs), and meanings of the words. Method\nCover the book content, listen to the recordings, recall the words, write them down, and remember their meanings. Create a separate list for words you cannot hear or write correctly and re-memorize them. Repeat the process until you can correctly write and recall the meanings of all words. Once you achieve this, look at the meanings and recall the Japanese words, reading them aloud. To improve speaking, you can also read aloud while listening in the first step. Efficiency Tips\nGradually reduce writing for familiar words. Be able to quickly recall the pronunciation, spelling, and meaning of words at normal playback speed. Enhance Memory and Resist Forgetting # Mindset Forgetting is normal; do not be discouraged. Forgetting indicates a need for reinforcement. Review Strategy Dictate all the week\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary every weekend, recalling meanings quickly (within one second). For forgotten words, create a separate list and review them along with new words the following week. Remove words from the list after two successful reviews. Add words to the list if they cause issues in later steps and review them using the above method. Maintaining this list can significantly improve vocabulary memorization efficiency. 4. After Mastering Vocabulary and Grammar, Dictate the Text # 1. Text Preparation # Do not open the textbook\u0026rsquo;s text section; dictate the text solely through recordings. 2. Dictation Method # First Dictation # Listen continuously without pausing for the first time. Possible scenarios: Understand the general idea but not the details. Understand parts but struggle with certain sections. Completely fail to understand. Solutions # Scenario 1 Reconstruct sentences based on your understanding and known vocabulary and grammar, then check against the recording. Repeatedly listen to or slow down unclear parts until corrected. Scenario 2 Write down understood parts and repeatedly listen to unclear sections, slowing down if necessary. If unable to understand, try writing the kana based on the sound to aid memory. This practice improves kana recognition accuracy, reducing errors common in subtitles. Scenario 3 Continue listening until it transforms into Scenario 1 or 2. If you have listened less than 50 times, do not give up; persist. 3. Check Against the Textbook # This step is crucial; writing is three parts, revising is seven. Do not merely check for correct and incorrect sentences. Analyze Errors Thoroughly: If due to unmemorized vocabulary, add to the forgotten words list for future review. If due to unmastered grammar, revisit the grammar; if still unclear, consult ChatGPT. If due to mishearing, repeatedly listen to the sentence until understood. There is no upper limit to repetitions. For example, long fixed expressions like \u0026ldquo;していただきます\u0026rdquo; are initially challenging but improve with practice. 5. Assessment and Reinforcement of Learning Content # After completing the above steps, clarify the following:\nMastered Content: Through dictation, vocabulary memorization, and text comprehension, identify what you have mastered.\nDeficient Content: Identify areas still problematic, such as vocabulary, grammar, or dictation accuracy.\nHandling Deficiencies # Repeatedly dictate, memorize, and understand until deficiencies are addressed. Meticulously Complete Exercises: Value of Simple Exercises: Word substitution exercises, though simple, effectively reinforce learning. Error Analysis: When checking answers, do not just judge right or wrong; understand: Why the error occurred? Where is the mistake? How to avoid similar mistakes? Record and Summarize: Document all errors, reflect, and improve during weekly reviews. Notes # Avoid Carelessness: Do not dismiss errors as carelessness; it indicates insufficient proficiency. Error Management: Summarize errors into a review checklist for regular gap-filling. Summary # Initially, textbooks are the best dictation materials due to limited knowledge and vocabulary. At a certain level, start dictating anime or Japanese drama content. Online resources with transcribed dialogues can be used for comparison but should not be fully trusted. Carefully discern and, if necessary, seek help from a native speaker. A good friend for language learners Chinese/English/Japanese language exchange bulletin board Without a language environment, even well-dictated content may fade over time. Consider using an MP3 during commutes or waiting times to repeatedly listen to Japanese content, adapting your ears to the language. Just be careful not to miss your stop. 6. Importance of Writing Practice # 1. Writing Schedule # Initial Stage (first two weeks): May struggle to form coherent content; gradually adapt. After Two Weeks: Write at least one essay per week. 2. Writing Content and Methods # Writing Goals: Write what you \u0026ldquo;want to write,\u0026rdquo; not just what you \u0026ldquo;can write.\u0026rdquo; Do not aim for literary excellence; even mundane content is fine as long as you persist. Strategies for Difficulties: Vocabulary: Use a dictionary to find necessary words. Grammar: Boldly use desired grammar, even if mistakes are possible. 3. Correcting Mistakes # Mistakes in writing are part of the learning process. ChatGPT can help correct these errors. 7. Encouraging Yourself # Record Achievements: Set learning goals and reward mechanisms, such as creating badges. Perseverance: No matter how slow the progress, as long as you do not stop, you are doing well. Avoid cramming for \u0026ldquo;false achievements\u0026rdquo;; real ability is what matters. There is no method that yields results without effort. But there are enjoyable methods that involve effort without pain. Wishing you success in your studies! Learning Japanese is a marathon; persistence is key.

The notes follow the course order, distilling key grammar points, vocabulary, and example sentences for each lesson, while preserving the course’s unique teaching philosophy.\n★ Core Notes for Japanese from Scratch Course (Lessons 1–93) # The notes are divided into key sections to reflect the course’s progressive structure:\nPart 1: Core Sentence Structure and Basic Particles (Lessons 1–20) Part 2: Verbs, Adjectives, and Tenses (Lessons 21–45) Part 3: Complex Sentences and Advanced Particle Usage (Lessons 46–70) Part 4: Advanced Grammar and Expressions (Lessons 71–93) ★ Part 1: Core Sentence Structure and Basic Particles (Lessons 1–20) # This section lays the foundation for the course, explaining the basic structure of Japanese sentences, the core particles が, は, も, and の, and how to express location, time, and tools.\n◇ [1–2] Core Sentence Structure # Core Concept: The Sentence Train All Japanese sentences consist of A (Subject/Main Carriage) and B (Predicate/Engine). A が B is the most basic sentence form. が is the “pin” linking the subject to the predicate. Three Basic Sentence Types: A does B (Verb Sentence): A が [verb ending in u] Example: さくら が あるく (Sakura ga aruku) – Sakura walks. A is B (Noun Sentence): A が [noun] だ だ (da) is the copula, like “is”. Example: さくら が 日本人(にほんじん) だ – Sakura is Japanese. A is B (Adjective Sentence): A が [i-adjective] i-adjectives contain the meaning of “is” inherently—だ is not needed. Example: ペン が あかい – The pen is red. Core Concept: Invisible Subject (Zero Pronoun) When context is clear, the subject A が is often omitted but still exists logically. Very common in spoken and written Japanese. Example: ケーキ を 食べる – Eat cake. (“I” or “you” is implied.) Particle を (o): Marks the direct object of a verb. Example: 私 が ケーキ を 食べる – I eat cake. ◇ Super Basic Japanese Vocabulary List # This list contains the most basic vocabulary for beginner learners, useful for building “A is B” and “A does B” sentences. Includes hiragana, romaji, and Chinese/English meanings.\nNouns\nうさぎ (usagi) = rabbit 兔子 ひと (hito) = person 人 こ (ko) = child 孩子 とり (tori) = bird 鸟 おんな の ひと (onna no hito) = woman 女人 おんな の こ (onna no ko) = girl 女孩 おとこ の ひと (otoko no hito) = man 男人 おとこ の こ (otoko no ko) = boy 男孩 にほんじん (Nihonjin) = Japanese person 日本人 あめりかじん (Amerikajin) = American person 美国人 ふらんすじん (Furansujin) = French person 法国人 ぱん (pan) = bread (same as Spanish) 面包 (Free gifts!)\nぺん (pen) = pen 钢笔 あいすくりーむ (aisu kuriimu) = ice cream 冰淇淋 たくしー (takushii) = taxi 出租车 けーき (keeki) = cake 蛋糕 Verbs\nあるく (aruku) = walk 走路，步行 とぶ (tobu) = jump/fly 跳跃/飞行 うたう (utau) = sing 唱歌 Adjectives\nあかい (akai) = red 红色的 あおい (aoi) = blue 蓝色的 うれしい (ureshii) = happy 高兴的，愉快的 おいしい (oishii) = tasty, delicious 好吃的，美味的 おもしろい (omoshiroi) = interesting, amusing 有趣的，好玩的 Study Tips\nPrioritize hiragana: Beginners should focus on mastering hiragana first. Gradual progression: After basics, move on to kanji and katakana. Practice sentences: Use these words to form simple sentences. Pronunciation: Use romaji to help practice correct pronunciation. ◇ [3–5] Core Particles は (wa) and も (mo) # Particle は (wa): Topic Marker は marks the “thing we’re talking about”—it pulls an element out of the sentence as the topic or context. は overrides が and を, but not other particles. X は Y が Z is a very common structure, meaning “As for X, Y is Z.” Example: 象(ぞう) は 鼻(はな) が 長(なが)い (zou wa hana ga nagai) – As for elephants, (their) noses are long. Particle も (mo): \u0026ldquo;Also / Too\u0026rdquo; Marker も indicates sameness or similarity to the previous statement. Like は, it overrides が and を. Example: 私 が 行く。あなた も 行く。 – I will go. You will go too. Example: ケーキ を 食べる。クッキー も 食べる。 – I eat cake. I also eat cookies. ◇ [6–10] Particle の (no) — Possession \u0026amp; Nominalization # Particle の (no): Possession and Descriptive Marker Most commonly used to indicate possession: X の Y = Y of X. Example: 私 の 猫 – My cat. Nominalization with の: Turns a verb or adjective phrase into a noun-like “thing.” Example: 赤い の が 好き – I like the red one. Replacing が with の in embedded clauses: Makes the tone softer or more explanatory. 私 が 行く → 私 の 行く... – the place “I go to”\u0026hellip; ◇ [11–20] Location, Direction, and Tool Particles # Particle に (ni): Static Location: With いる / ある to express existence. 猫 が 箱 に いる – The cat is in the box.

No Diphthongs:\nJapanese does not have true diphthongs, but similar effects can be achieved by vowel sequences (e.g., 「あい」/ai/). Long and Short Vowel Contrast:\nJapanese has a contrast between long and short vowels, with long vowels indicated by extending the vowel duration (e.g., 「おお」/oː/ vs. 「お」/o/). 14 Basic Consonants: /k/, /s/, /t/, /n/, /h/, /m/, /y/, /r/, /w/, /g/, /z/, /d/, /b/, /p/\nCharacteristics of Consonants:\nVoiced and Voiceless Contrast:\nVoiceless (unvoiced) sounds: e.g., 「か」(ka), 「さ」(sa), 「た」(ta).\nVoiced sounds: e.g., 「が」(ga), 「ざ」(za), 「だ」(da). Semi-Voiced Sounds:\nSemi-voiced sounds are aspirated variants of voiceless sounds, e.g., 「ぱ」(pa), 「ぴ」(pi), 「ぷ」(pu), 「ぺ」(pe), 「ぽ」(po). Consonant Weakening:\nIn some cases, consonants are weakened. For example, 「は」(ha) is pronounced as /wa/ when used as a particle. Lack of Certain Consonants:\nJapanese lacks certain consonants found in English, such as /th/, /v/, /f/. ◇Hiragana # n w- r- y- m- h- n- t- s- k- ん\n(n) わ ら や ま は な た さ か あ -a ゐ* り み ひ に ち\n(chi) し\n(shi) き い -i る ゆ む ふ\n(fu) ぬ つ\n(tsu) す く う -u ゑ* れ め へ ね て せ け え -e を\n(o) ろ よ も ほ の と そ こ お -o * = No longer used.\nHiragana is the basic phonetic unit of Japanese, capable of writing all Japanese words. However, since written Japanese does not use spaces, using only Hiragana can make text difficult to read.\nFollow stroke order to ensure smooth writing and avoid developing bad habits.\n「ん」 is the only kana without a vowel.\n「し」(shi), 「ち」(chi), 「つ」(tsu) have pronunciations different from the general consonant + vowel pattern.\n「r」 sound requires the tongue to touch the roof of the mouth.\n「tsu」 vs. 「su」 distinction.\n◇Katakana # n w- r- y- m- h- n- t- s- k- ン\n(n) ワ ラ ヤ マ ハ ナ タ サ カ ア -a ヰ* リ ミ ヒ ニ チ\n(chi) シ\n(shi) キ イ -i ル ユ ム フ\n(fu) ヌ ツ\n(tsu) ス ク ウ -u ヱ* レ メ ヘ ネ テ セ ケ エ -e ヲ*\n(o) ロ ヨ モ ホ ノ ト ソ コ オ -o * No longer used or rarely used.\nKatakana is primarily used for:\nLoanwords (e.g., コンピュータ - computer)\nEmphasis (similar to italics in English)\nOnomatopoeia (e.g., ドキドキ - heartbeat)\nSpecial purposes (e.g., biological names, brand names)\nKatakana pronunciations are identical to their Hiragana counterparts, only the writing differs. Loanwords must adapt to the Japanese [consonant + vowel] structure, which may alter their original pronunciation. For example, the English word \u0026ldquo;coffee\u0026rdquo; is written as 「コーヒー」(kōhī) in Japanese.\nWhen learning Katakana, it is essential to memorize the Japanese pronunciation rather than the original English pronunciation to avoid misunderstandings.\n◇Katakana Spelling Rules # When converting English words into Katakana, the following rules apply:\nNo distinction between L/R: Japanese does not distinguish between L and R, both are represented by the 「ラ」 row.\nReady → レディ Lady → レディ\nLong vowels: Consecutive vowels or words ending with /r/ are often converted into long vowels (ー).\nTarget → ターゲット\nShoot → シュート\nSokuon (small ッ): Used to represent a glottal stop or a doubled consonant.\nCatch → キャッチ\nCache → キャッシュ\nAdding vowels to consonant endings: Japanese words end with vowels (except for \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; due to 「ン」), so for \u0026ldquo;t\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;d\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;o\u0026rdquo; is usually added; for others, \u0026ldquo;u\u0026rdquo; is typically added:\nGood → グッド\nTop → トップ\nJack → ジャック\n◇Voiced and Semi-Voiced Sounds (Consonant Variants) # p- b- d- z- g- ぱ ば だ ざ が -a ぴ び ぢ\n(ji) じ\n(ji) ぎ -i ぷ ぶ づ\n(dzu) ず ぐ -u ぺ べ で ぜ げ -e ぽ ぼ ど ぞ ご -o Voiced Sounds: Formed by adding a dakuten (゛) to the kana, e.g.,\nか → が (ka → ga)\nさ → ざ (sa → za)\nSemi-Voiced Sounds: Formed by adding a handakuten (゜) to the kana, used only with the 「は」 row:\nは → ぱ (ha → pa)\nひ → ぴ (hi → pi)\n★Special Phonemes # Japanese has some special phonemes that do not belong to vowels or consonants but play an important role in pronunciation.\n◇Moraic Nasal: /N/ # The moraic nasal is usually written as 「ん」 and sounds like a nasal, but its exact pronunciation varies depending on the following phoneme. For example:\nIn 「さん」(san), /N/ is pronounced as /n/.\nIn 「しんぶん」(shinbun), /N/ is pronounced as /m/.\nIn 「りんご」(ringo), /N/ is pronounced as /ŋ/ (similar to the English \u0026ldquo;ng\u0026rdquo; sound).\n◇Gemination: /Q/ # Gemination is written as 「っ」 and represents the lengthening or doubling of a consonant. For example:\n「かった」(katta) uses 「っ」 to lengthen the /t/ sound.\n「きっぷ」(kippu) uses 「っ」 to lengthen the /p/ sound.\n◇Long Vowels # Long vowels are represented by extending the vowel sound, usually written as 「ー」 or by repeating the vowel. For example:\n「おおきい」(ookii) uses 「おお」 to extend the /o/ sound.\n「コーヒー」(koohii) uses 「ー」 to extend the vowel sound.\nVowel Kana Used for Lengthening /a/ あ /i/, /e/ い /u/, /o/ う Lengthen the pronunciation by adding the corresponding vowel after the kana.\nThe principle of long vowels is simple; try pronouncing 「か」 and 「あ」 separately, then quickly combine them. Soon, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that it feels like extending the /ka/ sound. When pronouncing long vowels, remember that you are essentially pronouncing two sounds.\n「ここ」(koko, here) vs. 「こうこう」(koukou, high school)\n「おばさん」(obasan, aunt) vs. 「おばあさん」(obaasan, grandmother)\nIn rare cases, the /e/ vowel is lengthened with 「え」, and the /o/ vowel is lengthened with 「お」. Examples include 「おねえさん」、「おおい」, and 「おおきい」. Be aware of these exceptions, though they are few.\nIn Katakana, long vowels are represented by 「ー」 without additional kana.\nExamples:\nツアー (tsu-a) → tour\nメール (me-ru) → email\nケーキ (ke-ki) → cake\n★Yōon (Palatalized Sounds) # Yōon are sounds formed by combining a consonant with /y/, usually written with small 「ゃ」「ゅ」「ょ」.\nThese sounds are very common in Japanese, especially in loanwords and compound words.\np- b- j- g- r- m- h- n- c- s- k- ぴゃ びゃ じゃ\n(ja) ぎゃ りゃ みゃ ひゃ にゃ ちゃ\n(cha) しゃ\n(sha) きゃ -ya ぴゅ びゅ じゅ\n(ju) ぎゅ りゅ みゅ ひゅ にゅ ちゅ\n(chu) しゅ\n(shu) きゅ -yu ぴょ びょ じょ\n(jo) ぎょ りょ みょ ひょ にょ ちょ\n(cho) しょ\n(sho) きょ -yo Combine small kana 「ゃ」「ゅ」「ょ」 with /i/ column kana to form new sounds, e.g.,\nき + ゃ = きゃ (kya)\nし + ゅ = しゅ (shu)\nち + よ = ちょ (cho)\n★Extended Syllables for Loanwords # Extended syllables are additional phonemes introduced to accommodate loanwords, not part of traditional Japanese phonology. They include:\nSmall kana: e.g., 「ァ、ィ、ゥ、ェ、ォ」\nAdditional consonants: e.g.,\n/v/ → ヴァ、ヴィ、ヴ、ヴェ、ヴォ、\n/f/ → ファ、フィ、フ、フェ、フォ、\n/ti/ → ティ、\n/di/ → ディ, etc.\nThese syllables are primarily used in loanwords, not native Japanese words.\nv- w- f- ch- d- t- j- sh- ヴァ ワ ファ チャ ダ タ ジャ シャ (-a) ヴィ ウィ フィ チ ディ ティ ジ シ (-i) ヴ ウ フ チュ ドゥ トゥ ジュ シュ (-u) ヴェ ウェ フェ チェ デ テ ジェ シェ (-e) ヴォ ウォ フォ チョ ド ト ジョ ショ (-o) Note:\n/wu/ sound does not exist:\nJapanese does not have a /wu/ sound, so loanwords like \u0026ldquo;woman\u0026rdquo; are written as 「ウーマン」(u-man).\n/tu/ sound spelling:\nAlthough modern Japanese uses 「トゥ」 for /tu/ (e.g., 「トゥデイ」\u0026ldquo;today\u0026rdquo;), older loanwords still use 「ツ」 (e.g., 「ツール」\u0026ldquo;tool\u0026rdquo;).\nEarly loanword spelling rules:\nFor example, \u0026ldquo;building\u0026rdquo; was originally written as 「ビルヂング」(birudingu), but modern usage writes it as 「ビルディング」(birudingu), reflecting the standardization of loanword spelling in Japanese.\nExamples:\n/v/ sound: 「ヴァイオリン」(violin)\n/f/ sound: 「ファミリー」(family)\n/ti/ and /di/ sounds: 「ティー」(tea), 「ディズニー」(Disney)\nLoanword Syllable Japanese Spelling Example /va/ ヴァ ヴァイオリン（violin） /wa/ ワ ワイン（wine） /fa/ ファ ファミリー（family） /cha/ チャ チャンス（chance） /da/ ダ ダンス（dance） /ta/ タ タクシー（taxi） /ja/ ジャ ジャズ（jazz） /sha/ シャ シャツ（shirt） ★Phonological Rules # Japanese phonological rules refer to the regular changes in pronunciation and phoneme combinations in Japanese. These rules affect not only the pronunciation of individual words but also the connection and transformation between words.\nJapanese phonological rules include:\nRendaku: Voicing of the initial consonant of the second word in a compound. Euphonic Changes: Changes in pronunciation for ease of articulation. Pitch Accent Rules: Each word has a specific pitch pattern. Vowel Devoicing: High vowels /i/ and /u/ become voiceless under certain conditions. Gemination: Consonant lengthening or doubling. Loanword Phonological Rules: Loanwords are adjusted according to Japanese phonology. ◇1. Rendaku # Rendaku is a common phonological phenomenon in Japanese where the initial consonant of the second word in a compound becomes voiced.\nRules:\nWhen two words combine to form a compound, the initial consonant of the second word may become voiced.\nVoiced consonants include: /k/ → /g/, /s/ → /z/, /t/ → /d/, /h/ → /b/.\nExamples:\n「て」(te) + 「かみ」(kami) → 「てがみ」(tegami, letter)\n「はな」(hana) + 「ち」(chi) → 「はなぢ」(hanaji, nosebleed)\n「おお」(oo) + 「とり」(tori) → 「おおどり」(oodori, large bird)\nExceptions:\nNot all compounds undergo rendaku. For example:\n「き」(ki) + 「かみ」(kami) → 「きかみ」(kikami, tree god) (no voicing)\n◇2. Euphonic Changes # Euphonic changes refer to changes in pronunciation for ease of articulation. These changes are mainly divided into the following types:\n（1）I-onbin # In the conjunctive form of verbs, /ki/ or /gi/ changes to /i/.\nExamples:\n「かく」(kaku, write) → 「かいて」(kaite, writing)\n「いそぐ」(isogu, hurry) → 「いそいで」(isoide, hurrying)\n（2）N-onbin # In the conjunctive form of verbs, /mu/, /bu/, /nu/ change to the moraic nasal 「ん」.\nExamples:\n「よむ」(yomu, read) → 「よんで」(yonde, reading)\n「あそぶ」(asobu, play) → 「あそんで」(asonde, playing)\n（3）Sokuonbin # In the conjunctive form of verbs, /tu/ or /ru/ changes to the geminate consonant 「っ」.\nExamples:\n「もつ」(motsu, hold) → 「もって」(motte, holding)\n「とる」(toru, take) → 「とって」(totte, taking)\n◇3. Pitch Accent Rules # Japanese is a pitch accent language, meaning each word has a specific pitch pattern. The pitch accent rules are as follows:\n（1）Pitch Types # Heiban (Flat): The first syllable is low, and subsequent syllables are high.\nExample: 「はし」(hashi, bridge) → low-high\nAtamadaka (Head-high): The first syllable is high, and subsequent syllables are low.\nExample: 「はし」(hashi, chopsticks) → high-low\nNakadaka (Middle-high): The first syllable is low, the middle syllable is high, and the last syllable is low.\nExample: 「さかな」(sakana, fish) → low-high-low\n（2）Pitch Changes # Pitch changes with the addition of particles or word endings. For example:\n「はし」(hashi, bridge) + 「が」(ga) → 「はしが」(hashiga, bridgeが) → low-high-low\n「はし」(hashi, chopsticks) + 「が」(ga) → 「はしが」(hashiga, chopsticksが) → high-low-low\n◇4. Vowel Devoicing # In certain situations, Japanese vowels become voiceless (almost silent), especially when high vowels /i/ and /u/ are followed by voiceless consonants.\nRules:\nHigh vowels /i/ and /u/ may become voiceless when between voiceless consonants (e.g., /k/, /s/, /t/, /h/) or at the end of a word.\nExamples:\n「です」(desu) → /des/ (「u」 becomes voiceless)\n「きく」(kiku, listen) → /kik/ (「u」 becomes voiceless)\n◇5. Gemination # Gemination refers to the lengthening or doubling of consonants, represented by the geminate consonant 「っ」.\nRules:\nIn compounds or verb conjugations, consonants may undergo gemination.\nExamples:\n「いっぽん」(ippon, one long object) → /Q/ represents the lengthening of /p/\n「きって」(kitte, stamp) → /Q/ represents the lengthening of /t/\n◇6. Loanword Phonological Rules # When Japanese absorbs loanwords, they are adjusted according to Japanese phonological rules:\n（1）Vowel Insertion # Japanese does not allow consonant clusters, so vowels are inserted between consonants.\nExamples:\n“strike” → 「ストライク」(sutoraiku)\n“McDonald” → 「マクドナルド」(makudonarudo)\n（2）Consonant Substitution # Japanese lacks certain consonants (e.g., /v/, /f/), so similar sounds are used instead.\nExamples:\n“video” → 「ビデオ」(bideo)\n“coffee” → 「コーヒー」(koohii)\n◇7. Historical Phonological Rules # Japanese phonology has undergone several changes throughout history, such as:\nOld Japanese: Had more vowels and consonants, such as 「ゐ」(wi) and 「ゑ」(we).\nMiddle Japanese: Vowels and consonants gradually simplified, forming the basis of modern Japanese.\nModern Japanese: Further simplification, incorporating loanword phonemes (e.g., 「ティ」(ti), 「ファ」(fa)).\n★Kanji # ◇Rules for Reading Kanji # On\u0026rsquo;yomi (音読み) and Kun\u0026rsquo;yomi (訓読み)\nEssentially, each kanji has two reading methods:\nOn\u0026rsquo;yomi (音読み): Derived from Chinese readings, mainly used in compound words (熟語).\nKun\u0026rsquo;yomi (訓読み): Native Japanese readings, typically used when the kanji appears alone.\nExamples:\nKanji Kun\u0026rsquo;yomi On\u0026rsquo;yomi Example Word 力 ちから りょく 能力（のうりょく） Some kanji may have multiple on\u0026rsquo;yomi or kun\u0026rsquo;yomi readings, e.g., 「怪力」（かいりき） reads 「りき」 instead of 「りょく」.\n◇Okurigana (送り仮名) # In verbs and adjectives, kanji are often followed by hiragana, known as okurigana. For example:\nVerbs: 「食べる」（たべる, eat）→「食べた」（たべた, ate） Adjectives: 「新しい」（あたらしい, new） Functions of Okurigana:\nDistinguish different word types (intransitive vs. transitive verbs). Indicate word inflections (tense, voice, etc.). ◇Sound Changes (Onbin) # Kanji in compound words may undergo sound changes for smoother pronunciation. For example:\n/h/ → /b/ or /p/: 一本（いっぽん） 徹底（てってい） 「つ」 becomes 「っ」: 格好（かっこう） ◇Distinctions Between Similar Kanji # Some kanji with similar meanings express subtle differences in different contexts. For example:\nDifferent Expressions for \u0026ldquo;Listen\u0026rdquo;\n聞く（きく）：General \u0026ldquo;listen\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ask\u0026rdquo;. 聴く（きく）：Specifically \u0026ldquo;listen attentively\u0026rdquo;, e.g., listening to a concert. 訊く（きく）：Only \u0026ldquo;inquire\u0026rdquo;. Different Expressions for \u0026ldquo;See\u0026rdquo;\n見る（みる）：General \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo;. 観る（みる）：Watch a performance, movie. Differences Between \u0026ldquo;Write\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Draw\u0026rdquo;\n書く（かく）：Write. 描く（かく）：Draw. 描く（えがく）：Depict (abstract scenes). ◇々——Repetition Symbol # Japanese has a special symbol 「々」, used to repeat the preceding kanji, for example:\n時時 → 時々（ときどき） 様様 → 様々（さまざま） 色色 → 色々（いろいろ） 一一 → 一々（いちいち） Back to the series index\n","date":"25 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/japanese-2-kana/","section":"Blog","summary":"Introduces the structure, pronunciation, and learning techniques of Japanese kana to help build a solid foundation.","title":"Japanese Kana","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/kana/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kana","type":"tags"},{"content":"Back to the series index\nJapanese pronunciation involves pitch accents that are categorized into high and low tones. When pronouncing words, it is important to check whether there is a drop point (a place where the pitch suddenly falls). For words with a drop point, each has its own specific position for that drop. Different pitch patterns require different pronunciation methods.\nWhen a word has a drop point, it is indicated by the symbol \u0026ldquo;↓\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen a word has no drop point, it is marked with the symbol \u0026ldquo;○\u0026rdquo; at the end.\n★Pronunciation When Reading Words # When reading a word, start with a low pitch and then gradually raise it. Maintain a high pitch until you encounter the ↓ symbol; at that point, the pitch drops. For words without a drop point (marked with ○), maintain a high pitch all the way to the end.\nIf the ↓ symbol appears on the very first mora of the word, start with a high pitch, then immediately lower it.\nIf the ↓ symbol appears at the end of the word, the pitch drops after that point. When reading the word alone, its pronunciation is the same as that of a word without a drop point. The audio includes both the standalone pronunciation and the version followed by \u0026ldquo;～です.\u0026rdquo;\nSome words have a pause in the middle, after which the pitch rises again. In this case, the pause is marked with △.\nWhen a single word can be pronounced in two acceptable ways, both options are listed separated by \u0026ldquo;／.\u0026rdquo;\n★Pronunciation in Sentences # When reading a sentence, start with a low pitch and gradually raise it. Maintain the high pitch until reaching the ↓ symbol, at which point the pitch begins to fall.\nIf a sentence has two or more drop points, the pitch drop at the first ↓ is larger, while subsequent drops are smaller.\nIf there is a pause in the sentence or a segment you want to emphasize (the focus part), the pitch rises again from that point.\nIn yes-no or interrogative sentences, the pitch rises at the end.\nPitch accent significantly influences the overall intonation of a sentence.\n★How to Practice Pitch Accent # When listening to audio, pay attention to the pitch patterns of each word. Then look at the pitch markings to confirm where the drop occurs. Think about how these pitch differences affect pronunciation.\nWhen shadowing, be mindful of pitch changes as you mimic the sounds.\nAs you gradually understand the relationship between pitch and pronunciation, try to pay attention to pitch even when speaking sentences you create yourself.\nIf you can focus on pitch first and then speak, your pronunciation will sound more natural and easier to understand.\nBack to the series index\n","date":"24 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/japanese-1-accent/","section":"Blog","summary":"An introduction to the basic rules of Japanese pitch accent and its importance in language expression.","title":"Japanese Pitch Accent","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pitch-accent/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pitch Accent","type":"tags"},{"content":" ★A Few Reminders at the Beginning # ◇About \u0026ldquo;Essence\u0026rdquo; # First, remember that language is not \u0026ldquo;learned\u0026rdquo; through conscious study, but is \u0026ldquo;acquired\u0026rdquo; naturally through use and immersion. It is not static knowledge, but dynamic practice. In the process of language learning, there is no absolute \u0026ldquo;know\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rdquo;—only ever-deepening understanding and application.\nThe optimal solution for language learning is to spend most of your time engaging with language content, understanding and trying to express, and only a small portion of time on memorizing words and grammar.\n◇About \u0026ldquo;Traps\u0026rdquo; # A common pitfall in language learning: staying with beginner resources for too long and fearing to enter the real language environment, thinking you should \u0026ldquo;be ready\u0026rdquo; before practicing.\nHowever, language learning is like climbing a mountain: just weaving ropes (studying theory) won\u0026rsquo;t get you to the summit; only actual climbing (practical use) leads to mastery. Early exposure to real contexts enables you to adapt and improve your comprehension quickly.\n◇About \u0026ldquo;Immersion\u0026rdquo; # The breadth and complexity of language far exceed what classrooms or apps can teach. These methods often try to teach language using formulas like \u0026ldquo;X equals Y\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;X is used for Y,\u0026rdquo; but this is not enough for learners to reach a high level.\nTherefore, the core of language learning is \u0026ldquo;immersion\u0026rdquo;—that is, as much reading of native content and listening to native speakers as possible.\nLanguage acquisition is essentially the process of subconsciously remembering language patterns through comprehensible input. When you encounter understandable content during immersion, your brain automatically stores these patterns for future retrieval and use.\nTechnically, this is called \u0026ldquo;input,\u0026rdquo; but I prefer the term \u0026ldquo;immersion.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen you are familiar enough with a language, all of this becomes almost effortless. You not only understand the meaning of words, but also the logical relationships between sentences, and can even sense the tone and formality of an article—all thanks to your brain continually storing and recalling language patterns encountered in your reading.\nNotice, I did not mention \u0026ldquo;mastering grammar\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;memorizing vocabulary.\u0026rdquo; Because using a language does not depend on consciously analyzing grammar rules, but on extensive immersion and intuitive response. Many non-native speakers may have studied grammar, but when they encounter the language in daily life, their understanding does not rely on actively recalling rules, but on the natural cognitive patterns formed through long-term accumulation.\n★Three Core Skills of Language Comprehension # ◇Phoneme Discrimination (Bottom-Up) # Different languages have very different sound systems. For example, English speakers learning Chinese may find it hard to distinguish \u0026ldquo;yīng\u0026rdquo; (eagle) and \u0026ldquo;yīn\u0026rdquo; (sound). Even if they have learned the theory, their brains still struggle to distinguish these subtle differences in real conversations. This shows that knowledge and ability are two different things; just learning pronunciation rules does not enable the brain to automatically recognize phonemes—this skill must be developed through extensive listening practice.\n◇Adapting to Connected Speech and Phonological Changes (Bottom-Up) # In natural conversation, words are not pronounced as clearly as in writing. For example, in spoken English, \u0026ldquo;don’t + you\u0026rdquo; often becomes \u0026ldquo;don-chew,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;want + to\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;wanna.\u0026rdquo; Similar phenomena are common in French, Spanish, and other languages. If learners do not get enough listening input, their brains will still expect words to appear in standard written form, leading to difficulty understanding speech.\n⚠️Note:\nBy \u0026ldquo;bottom-up,\u0026rdquo; I mean starting from the sounds you notice, then putting them together to see what word they form.\n/k/ + /æ/ + /t/ → cat\nBut because spoken language is often very ambiguous\u0026hellip; bottom-up processing alone is usually not enough to identify the words being spoken.\n◇Using Context to Infer Meaning (Top-Down) # Phonological ambiguity means that multiple words or phrases have the same pronunciation. For example, in English, \u0026ldquo;bat\u0026rdquo; might mean a baseball bat or a flying mammal, and \u0026ldquo;I got a letter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;I let her go\u0026rdquo; can sound similar in connected speech. Learners need to rely on context to infer the correct meaning, and this inferencing ability can only be developed through extensive listening in real situations.\n★How to Effectively Improve Language Comprehension # Extensive listening input: Practice listening to your target language for hours every day, even if you don’t understand at first. Listen to native conversations: Choose original podcasts, movies, TV series, etc. without subtitles to train your brain to adapt to real speech. Imitate native pronunciation: Use shadowing and similar methods to improve your recognition and pronunciation skills. Infer meaning from context: Avoid translating word for word; instead, try to understand the overall meaning of sentences.
